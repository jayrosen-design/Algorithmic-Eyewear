# Algorithmic Eyewear by Jay Rosen Design

Welcome to the Algorithmic Eyewear repository. This project showcases explorations into eyewear design at the intersection of art, technology, and perception, by Jay Rosen Design.

## About the Concept

"Algorithmic Eyewear" appears to represent a conceptual or artistic series by Jay Rosen, rather than a commercially mass-produced product line. Jay Rosen Design is known for innovative ocular devices and experiences, notably under the **Mirror Visionwear** label, which often feature as experimental art and fashion sculptures.

The work aligns with principles of:
* **Generative Design:** Utilizing algorithms to explore a diverse range of unique design possibilities.
* **Parametric Design:** Employing parameters and rules to define, modify, and customize designs.
* **Digital Fabrication:** Leveraging technologies like 3D printing to bring complex, algorithmically-derived forms to life.

Jay Rosen's broader work indicates a focus on bridging optical experiments with digital technologies, including machine learning, AR/VR, and other advanced computational techniques to realize "impossible designs." Mentions of "Algorithmic Eyewear" have been noted in contexts such as an NFT art submission (e.g., "Algorithmic Eyewear #26") and potentially as a title for specific projects or demonstrations.

This collection of images likely represents a portfolio of these design explorations, showcasing various forms and concepts developed through algorithmic processes.
